# Simple Rails CLI

This is a project that aims to help you manage your local environment based on RoR (however you can also adapt this to your stack) by running the necessary `docker-compose` commands so you dont have to remember them each time.


# Prerequisites

- Linux / MacOS
- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Use it

1. Place the [Script](https://github.com/Dvelezs94/simple-rails-cli/blob/master/simple-cli) in your project root folder
2. `bash simple-cli path`
3. `simple-cli help`


## Considerations

- Make sure your main container is called `app`, or update the script as you need
